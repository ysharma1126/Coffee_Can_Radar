# Coffee_Can_Radar

Built a small, short-range radar where the transmit and recieve antennas are Coffee Cans. Utilized RF Components and built video gain stage and anti-alias filter using quad op amp, and analog ramp generator with trigger output. 

Connects to audio input of computer for digitization of video and triggering 

MATLAB scripts read the .wav files and sort out triggered pulses and groups of pulses to process the 3 modes of operation: Doppler vs time, Range vs Time, and Synethetic Aperture Imaging (SAR)
